## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 We were able to get the frontend and the backend of Exploreio connected.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

1. Image Carousel on the landing page (RESOLVED)
2. CSS-related issues (RESOLVED)
3. Bootstrap packages (RESOLVED)

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

Yes

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

Our instructors provided us with information on how to use a Jira board, which has been helpful with assigning tasks and breaking down the project.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

The ability to search for prices- with all the varying components being implemented on the website, this feature is somewhat at risk.
