## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

We completed the finishing touches to the styling for the sign-in and registration pages, updated our Info Card and we're almost done with the activities component of Favorites.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 1. Linking SlidingCard to InfoCard (RESOLVED)
 2. Getting the favorites Card to flip (RESOLVED)

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 Yes

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 The feedback and advice along with the resources we've recieved from our mentors and instructors have been very helpful.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 Due to the amount of work and the time we have left, the comments section was a stretch feature we considered to be "at risk" so we've decided to remove this task.
