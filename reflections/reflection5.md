# Reflection #5

Pod Members: **Abbas, Dina, and Emanda**

## Reflection Questions

* How was the pacing of the capstone project? (i.e too slow, just right, too fast)

Just right

* To what extent did your plan change over the course of development? Knowing that you know now, what would you do differently if you were starting over?

Our plan for certain components change over the past couple weeks, but we also ended up circling back to our original ideas. There isn't much we would change about our capstone project timeline.

* How helpful were the labs and weekly assignments in preparing of to create a capstone project? Be specific, what topics do you still have questions about that may or may not have been covered?
  
1. LifeTracker- Registration and Login (backend and frontend)
2. Student Store- NavBar set up
3. PostgreSQL flex lessons

* When planning for the capstone project, which resources were the most helpful? (i.e mentors, instructors & TAs, ideation process, pod syncs, wireframes, sprint planning, bug bash, practice demo day, etc.)

Our mentors and instructors were super helpful in the planning process. In terms of resources, wireframing and setting up our Jira board supported us in staying on track over the weeks.
