## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 Our group was able to complete our InfoCard component. Additionally, we cleaned up our Jira board and we're on track to have our MVP done for Friday.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

1. Our updated images expired (RESOLVED)

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 Yes

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 Our classmates' demos and flex lessons have been really helpful in providing us with new ideas for features to implement.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?
