# Project Proposal

Pod Members: **Abbas, Dina and Emanda**

## Problem Statement

Insert your groups problem statement and target audience.

Research suggests that 20% of adults are indecisive. Moreover, cheap flights and vacation/destination spots can be difficult to find. Finding good areas to go to or see while traveling in a location can also be challenging. Perfect for people who donâ€™t want to deal with the stress of planning and are looking for budget friendly trips.

## Description

What is the main purpose of your project? What are the key features your site has to offer its users? How will your targeted audience use your website?

For our project, we aim to create an application that addresses the challenges mentioned above by offering users with curated travel packages based on customers' budgetary constraints. Our app will provide a user-friendly interface where customers can input their desired destination. In return, the user will receive recommendations for the best flights, hotels and sightseeing options (whether this is tourist hotspots or hidden gems).

## Expected Features List

Add a list of your groups's brainstormed features list
