# Project Proposal

Pod Members: **Abbas, Dina, and Emanda**

## Problem Statement

Research suggests that 20% of adults are indecisive. Moreover, cheap flights and vacation/destination spots can be difficult to find. Finding good areas to go to or see while traveling in a location can also be challenging. Perfect for people who donâ€™t want to deal with the stress of planning and are looking for budget-friendly trips.

## User Roles

Traveler: a user who is seeking help planning budget-friendly trips/vacations

## User Personas

She needs help planning and arranging the details of this trip. Aisha also wants to plan this trip quickly.
2. College Student: Milos is a 20-year-old college junior who lives in rural Grand Forks, North Dakota. He is desperately looking to get out of the area with his friends to get away for Spring Break.
