## Problem Statement and Description

Insert the latest summary of your problem statement and app description.

1. Research suggests that 20% of adults are indecisive. Moreover, cheap flights and vacation/destination spots can be difficult to find. Finding good areas to go to or see while traveling in a location can also be challenging. Perfect for people who donâ€™t want to deal with the stress of planning and are looking for budget-friendly trips.
2. For our project, we aim to create an application that addresses the challenges mentioned above by offering users with curated travel packages based on customers' budgetary constraints. Our app will provide a user-friendly interface where customers can input their desired destination. In return, the user will receive recommendations for the best flights, hotels and sightseeing options (whether this is tourist hotspots or hidden gems).

## User Roles and Personas

Include the most up-to-date user roles and personas.
Traveler: a user who is seeking help planning budget-friendly trips/vacations

1. Aisha is a 32-year-old mother with 3 kids living in suburban Fairfax, Virginia. She is a pediatric surgeon at the local hospital and barely has time for herself and her family, but wants to go on a family vacation so that they can spend more time together. She needs help planning and arranging the details of this trip. Aisha also wants to plan this trip quickly.
2. Milos is a 20-year-old college junior who lives in rural Grand Forks, North Dakota. He is desperately looking to get out of the area with his friends to get away for Spring Break. Milos and his friends are on a strict budget, which is making it hard to find good deals in the locations they are considering.
